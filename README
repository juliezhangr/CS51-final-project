Notes:

.gitignore file holds directories for bulk data, if you change the default directories the
program uses, make sure to modify this file to ignore them, or else you might dump your inbox
onto github

get_mail.py can be used to get the contents of your inbox/spam folder for testing. Make sure to
change the constants for your own email

supported options:
    -g, gets the inbox and spam folders from a user's email client, and places them locally in to 
    -f, filtering mode.
    -t, training mode
    -e, email, which is a string in format, 'HOST'PORT;USER'
    -i, input directories, or email folders, in format 'NONSPAM;SPAM'
    -o, output, 'NONSPAM;SPAM', if -i is on, then local directories,
    if -e is on, then email folders
